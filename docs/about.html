        <h1>About Subspecies Mapper</h1>
        <p>This website displays maps of subspecies eBird reports for 1311 species with reportable subspecies on eBird. Sensitive species and species without any subspecies reported to eBird are not included.</p>
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>For a given species, maps display all reported "infraspecies" of the three following categories, following the <a href="https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data/the-ebird-taxonomy">eBird taxonomy</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subspecies</strong>: Taxonomic units follow subspecific boundaries as defined by the Clements checklist. May include groups of 2+ subspecies</li>
            <li><strong>Forms</strong>: Catch-all for forms without a scientific name, including identifiable groups, unrecognized groups that may represent distinct taxa, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Intergrades</strong>: Birds descended from multiple subspecies, forms, or both</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Data downloads</h3>
        <p><b>Want to create your own maps?</b> Tables of subspecies data used to create these maps are available <a href="https://github.com/rhine3/subspecies_mapper/tree/main/resources/sp_cell_dfs">here</a> (see usage requirements below).
        <p> Maps for each species are separated by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>H3 resolution:</b> either resolution 2, 3, or 4. See <a href="https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/">H3 documentation</a> for more information.</li>
            <li><b>Report status:</b> either "unflagged", reports that were not originally flagged by eBird filters, or "flagged and accepted" reports that were confirmed by eBird reviewers.</li>
        </ul>
